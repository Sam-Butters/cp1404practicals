# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Generally they were quite close, but underestimated, however the large program in prac 07 took significantly longer.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It stayed roughly the same.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

That I work better when trying to keep to a time frame.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Most of the feedback I received was very general. Of the issues that were raised, they tended to be small details that
I missed such as typos in print outputs.
This tells me that I need to put more effort into reviewing my own code prior to submitting it, and the importance of 
carefully reading the question.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I found performing code reviews very beneficial. Gaining a different perspective allowed me to see flaws in my own code,
showing me things I was doing well, and areas where I could improve. 
I also genuinely enjoyed the code review process, I like seeing how other people approach problems and trying to 
understand their thought process.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code review 1 (prac 5)](https://github.com/hiayethta/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

This review provided clear and constructive feedback in a positive manner. Each comment addressed a specific issue with 
helpful suggestions, making it easy for the author to understand and correct the mistakes.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code review 2 (prac 6)](https://github.com/chenhaoxiang-jcu/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

This review highlights the excellent quality of the code, focusing on what was done well, in the absence of many 
problems to discuss. Of the single issue found, feedback was constructive and offered suggestions for improvement.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would reduce the time spent on review tasks earlier in the term, allowing for more time on more difficult topics such
as classes, Kivy, etc.
I would also reduce the prac load during the assignment weeks.

Another thing I would focus more on is rewriting old prac code with new knowledge, similarly to how assignment 2 had us 
updating assignment 1 using classes. Getting the chance to look at my old code and see how it could be improved was one
of the most beneficial parts of this subject for me.
I think having the opportunity to regain a percentage of a prac's mark from fixing code after receiving feedback would 
be hugely beneficial.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

All of my practicals had room for improvement. They were all on time and complete, and I generally felt that I 
understood the content, but I don't feel I did 'really well' for any of them.
