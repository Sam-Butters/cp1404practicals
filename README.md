## Subject lessons

Three lessons about clean code I have learned in this subject:

- DRY - Don't repeat yourself.
    - If it feels like you're writing the same thing over and over, there is probably a more efficient way.
- Good identifier names make for self-documenting code.
    - If you need a comment to explain a name, it probably isn't a good name.
    - Use words from the problem domain.
    - Don't use abbreviations.
- Commenting:
    - Comments should be concise and descriptive, but not state the obvious.
    - Don't create maintenance burdens. e.g. Filenames in comments that may need to be changed later.
    - "This function will" or similar is always redundant.
