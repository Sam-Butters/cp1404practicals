# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Friday mornings for CP1404 starting around 9, with the following Tuesday and Thursday as a backup. Duration is a few
hours, depending on the difficulty of the content. Location is at home, in my study.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Interacting in lectures to keep myself accountable.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Stay on schedule, this week I have fallen behind (due to external factors), and I am feeling stressed catching up.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Results aren't currently in, however I think I need to work on writing succinct function and commit messages.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

At this stage I feel I am understanding the content easily, and writing python has felt more natural than last term.
