# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Based on my previous reflection, nothing. However, based on the difficulties I have had keeping up in the last few
weeks, I have made more time to fully understand the content of this class by dropping an elective subject.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Start pracs earlier, don't fall for the trap of putting things off when I'm ahead, because almost always that ends up
with my falling behind.
Improve sleep.
Work on distraction addiction.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Being consistent with lecture videos.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to change the way I handle 'finished' work and start reviewing my own code after I think I'm done.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Overall I think this subject is structured very well.
